### Installation

<strong>To Install *Nopi*:</strong>

```$ npm install nopi.js -g```

To see a list of commands:

```$ nopi```
___
### Project Generation

<strong>To Generate a new API or MVC project:</strong>

```$ nopi new name```

When you create a new project, *Nopi* will ask for project type and run ```npm install``` automatically in the project directory Nopi generates. All you have to do is be patient, it is not frozen.

Once it is done, cd to new project and start the server with:

```$ npm run dev```

### Database Selection

When generating a new project, you can select from two database types:

```mongo``` || ```postgres```

In your projects ```package.json``` there is a ```nopi_database``` field that
is used in Model file creation.

### File Generation

<strong>To generate a new view, controller, or model file:</strong>

```$ nopi view fileName```

```$ nopi controller fileName```

```$ nopi model fileName```   

#### View Files

View files generated by Nopi are just functions that return a template literal string. Instead of using a template framework, Nopi MVC uses regular template strings to produce HTML and inject data. Once a view file is generated, you can connect it to a route in a controller.

#### Controller Files

Controller files which are generated by *Nopi* should be added to the ```index.js``` controller file. Once added to the index, they are connected to the Express server. Within the Controller files generated by *Nopi*, you can route, create CRUD actions, and do anything you wish with your API.

#### Model Files

Model files which are generated by *Nopi* change depending on the type of project API that was generated. Within the ```package.json``` there is a ```nopi_database``` field with the type of DB chosen on generation.

*Nopi* uses this field inside the ```package.json``` to determine which Model file it needs to generate.

MongoDB: If ```mongo``` is chosen on API generation, ```mongoose.js``` is used by default and Models which work with ```mongoose.js``` which be chosen.

Postgresql: If ```postgres``` is chosen on API generation, ```sequelize.js``` is used and Models and Migrations used within ```sequelize.js``` will be generated.

<strong>Use these commands in the root of your project.</strong>

##### <strong>On File Creation Specifics:</strong>

On file creation, *Nopi* will look through your working project directory for controller and model folders and create the corresponding file type. If none of these folders exist, *Nopi* will create the file in the root of your project.

*Nopi* also creates ```.nopiPath``` folder in your project and saves the path of the file type generated. This is to optimize the speed of file creation. By saving this path *Nopi* does not have to dynamically find the folder again after each generated file.

If your project directory changes at all, delete ```.nopiPath``` folder to recache folder paths. ```.nopiPath``` folder is added to ```.gitignore``` also.

You cannot create files that already exist.
